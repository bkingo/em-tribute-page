				<h3 id="quote">"It's very difficult to start companies and quite painful, and that's important to bear in mind. That's probably not encouraging. Let me put it this way: If you need inspiring words, dont do it." - Elon Musk on TV</h3>
				<p>Elon Musk is a visionary that has been able to repeatedly [see an unseen need for something, and then take advantage of that void.] *change this* First it was launching Zip2 and its online city guide software, and later co-founding Paypal.com (formerly X.com), which helped usher in the era of online banking.</p>

				<p>Despite his early sucesses with the Internet, he has since moved on. While many of this generation's smartest minds spend time getting people to click on ads, Musk instead is creating new companies in various other industries, and although he appears a newcomer, these businesses are thriving today. 

				<p>As different as his companies may be, they are all united by an underlying drive to usher humanity along to advancement and sustainability. Given Musk's net worth at $13.9 billion, it might seem strange that some of his major projects are so successful yet still have strong conservationist intentions. 

				<p>Rather than coincidence, it is more likely that Musk has a knack for spotting the interesection between design, technology, and business, allowing him to take profitable risks while still achieving humanitarian aims. As a result, quite a few people are starting to turn their heads.</p>

				<p>Current projects Musk is involved in:</p>
				<ul class="project-list">
					<li class="spacex">
						<img src="img/5842a770a6515b1e0ad75afe.png" alt="SpaceX logo" id="spacex-logo">
						<p>SpaceX is a private company that designs, manufactures and launches advanced rockets and spacecraft with the ultimate goal of reducing space transporation costs and enabling people to live on other planets.</p>
						<p>After failing to purchase affordable rockets in the early 2000s, Musk realized that, taking into acccount factors like the cost of raw materials, it would actually be cheaper to produce most launch hardware in-house to build the cost-effective rockets he needed.</p>
						<p>One of the company's major goals is the developement of a rapidly resuable launch system whose individual stages can be retrieved (via propulsion systems) instead of being thrown away, as in the case of the space shuttle.</p>
						<!-- <p>Despite some setbacks in the company's past, it has had many success including being contracted by NASA to resupply the International Space Station (ISS). Furthermore, due to its low launch prices, SpaceX has been recently generating market pressure on competitors (some are undergoing a restructing of processes and workforce as a result) to lower their own prices.</p> -->
					</li>
					<li class="tesla">
						<img src="img/Tesla-Motors-symbol.png" alt="Tesla red and black logo" id="tesla-logo">
						<p>Mission: To accelerate the worldâ€™s transition to sustainable energy.</p>
						<p>Tesla, Inc. is an American automaker, energy storage company, and solar panel manufacturer, famous for their production of zero-emission electric cars on a commercial scale.</p>
						<p>Tesla electric cars can be chared at home, so there's no need for a gas station. For traveling long distance, Tesla's supercharger network provides access to high-speed charging along popular routes in North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. 
						<p>Additionally, these superchargers are completely free to use, which compensates for the initial cost of buying a car.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="openai">
						<img src="img/OpenAI_Logo.svg.png" alt="OpenAI chrome logo" id="openai-logo">
						<div class="clear-text">
						<p>Mission: To build safe AGI (artificial general intelligence), and ensure AGI's benefits are as widely and evenly distributed as possible.</p>

						<p>OpenAI is a non-profit AI research company whose mission to democratize the power of AI is meant to protect humanity from any future existential risks due to AI by communicating its research and publicly sharing it's open-source software tools.</p>
						<!-- <p>April 2016 - OpenAI released a public beta of "OpenAI Gym": a platform for reinforcement learning research  aiming to standardizing the way in which environments are defined in AI research publications, to make published research more reproducible.</p>

						<p>December 2016 - OpenAI released "Universe", a software platform for measuring and training an AI's general intelligence across the world's supply of games, websites and other applications.</p> -->
